## Description

Covers Samba which is the Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix that allow for end users to access and use files, printers, and other commonly shared resources on a company's intranet or internet also known as an NFS(network file system).

Samba is based on the common client/server protocol of Server Message Block(SMB) which is developed only for Windows. Without Sambda, other computer platforms would be isolated from other Windows machines, even on the same network.
